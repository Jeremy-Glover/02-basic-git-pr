Software development may not be a superpower.<br>
But you can help artists, craftsman, nonprofits and local businesses<br>
further expose their skills and services to a wider audience.<br>
That's one of the reasons I choose to develop websites and applications<br>
that allow people to grow their ideas and vision<br>
into something long-lasting and profitable.
